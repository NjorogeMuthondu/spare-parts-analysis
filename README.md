# spare-parts-analysis
You're working for a company that sells motorcycle parts, and they've asked for some help in analyzing their sales data!
They operate three warehouses in the area, selling both retail and wholesale. They offer a variety of parts and accept credit cards, cash, and bank transfer as payment methods. However, each payment type incurs a different fee.

The board of directors wants to gain a better understanding of wholesale revenue by product line, and how this varies month-to-month and across warehouses. You have been tasked with calculating net revenue for each product line and grouping results by month and warehouse. The results should be filtered so that only "Wholesale" orders are included.

SQL

# PROJECT WALKTHROUGH
I run some queries inorder to clean data and to format it the way the directors wanted.

I filtered it so that only wholesale details were shown.

I added two new columns to show the month the transaction took palce and the month number.

I also computed net revenue from total sales and the payment fee costs given.

# OUTCOME
The directors were able to see the performance of the wholesale warehouses at a glance.

Below are some of the screenshots from the final data.
